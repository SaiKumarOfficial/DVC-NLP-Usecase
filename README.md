# Automated Python Review Categorization

## Overview

This project aims to automate the categorization of reviews using Python and various technologies such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), DVC, AIOps, Continuous ML, and Flask. The system utilizes NLP techniques to analyze and categorize reviews efficiently. The project also implements DVC for data version control, ensuring reproducibility and scalability. AIOps and Continuous ML methodologies are integrated to enhance automation and streamline the ML workflow. Finally, Flask is employed to develop a user-friendly interface for accessing the review categorization system.

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project environment:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

### Step 2: Create Conda Environment

```bash
conda create --prefix ./env python=3.9 -y
conda activate ./env
# OR
source activate ./env
```

### Step 3: Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

dvc init
```

### Step 5: Commit and Push Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
```

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can proceed with the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare your review dataset or utilize the provided dataset.
2. **Preprocessing**: Preprocess the data for NLP tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and stop word removal.
3. **Model Training**: Train your NLP model using the prepared data.
4. **Integration with DVC**: Version control your data and model using DVC for reproducibility and scalability.
5. **Automated Categorization**: Implement automation techniques for categorizing reviews using AI/ML algorithms.
6. **Continuous Integration/Deployment**: Integrate CI/CD pipelines for continuous model training and deployment.
7. **Web Interface Development**: Develop a web interface using Flask for accessing the review categorization system.
